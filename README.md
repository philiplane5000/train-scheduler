# train-scheduler

### FEATURES:
* "MINUTES AWAY" and "NEXT TRAIN TIME" updates once every minute.

### BUGS / IMPROVEMENTS:
* Add Train needs a card-title

### Bonus (Extra Challenges):

* Try adding `update` and `remove` buttons for each train. Let the user edit the row's elements-- allow them to change a train's Name, Destination and Arrival Time (and then, by relation, minutes to arrival).

* As a final challenge, make it so that only users who log into the site with their Google or GitHub accounts can use your site. You'll need to read up on Firebase authentication for this bonus exercise.
